    [ve:v1.2.3]
    [00:14.99]I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
    [00:18.74]Been saying Yes instead of No
    [00:22.24]I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
    [00:28.74]I hit the ground running each night
    [00:32.23]I hit the Sunday matinee
    [00:35.74]You know the greatest films of all time were never made
    [00:42.49]I guess you never know, never know
    [00:46.23]And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
    [00:49.75]And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
    [00:52.49]And it's alright now
    [00:56.49]But we were something, don't you think so?
    [00:59.74]Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
    [01:03.23]And if my wishes came true
    [01:06.99]It would've been you
    [01:10.24]In my defense, I have none
    [01:13.48]For never leaving well enough alone
    [01:16.99]But it would've been fun
    [01:20.74]If you would've been the one
    [01:30.99]I have this dream you're doing cool shit
    [01:33.99]Having adventures on your own
    [01:37.51]You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
    [01:44.48]We never painted by the numbers, baby
    [01:47.74]But we were making it count
    [01:51.26]You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
    [01:58.24]I guess you never know, never know
    [02:01.74]And it's another day, waking up alone
    [02:05.24]But we were something, don't you think so?
    [02:08.24]Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
    [02:11.99]And if my wishes came true
    [02:15.75]It would've been you
    [02:19.24]In my defense, I have none
    [02:21.98]For never leaving well enough alone
    [02:25.74]But it would've been fun
    [02:29.24]If you would've been the one
    [02:32.49]Hey, yeah-yeah
    [02:34.49]Persist and resist the temptation to ask you
    [02:38.24]If one thing had been different
    [02:41.24]Would everything be different today?
    [02:46.22]We were something, don't you think so?
    [02:49.74]Ros√© flowing with your chosen family
    [02:52.74]And it would've been sweet
    [02:56.48]If it could've been me
    [03:00.24]In my defense, I have none
    [03:03.24]For digging up the grave another time
    [03:06.74]But it would've been fun
    [03:10.26]If you would've been the one`,
